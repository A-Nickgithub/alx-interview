You need to write a function that, given a list of coin denominations and a total amount, returns the minimum number of coins required to make the total. The problem tests your ability to work with optimization algorithms.To solve this problem efficiently, you can start by considering both greedy and dynamic programming approaches. The dynamic programming solution will be more robust in cases where the greedy approach fails.
