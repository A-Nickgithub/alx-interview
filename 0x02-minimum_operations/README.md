The 0x02. Minimum Operations project is focused on developing an efficient algorithm to determine the minimal number of operations required to achieve exactly n characters, starting from a single character on a notepad. The operations permitted are Copy All and Paste, which necessitate a strategic approach to minimize the total actions taken. Key algorithmic concepts such as dynamic programming, prime factorization, and greedy algorithms play a crucial role in solving this problem. Dynamic programming helps break down the problem into manageable subproblems, while prime factorization reduces it to summing the prime factors of n. The greedy algorithmic approach ensures that locally optimal choices lead to a global optimum. The project is implemented in Python, adhering to PEP 8 style guidelines, and includes comprehensive documentation to explain the solution. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust and optimized solution that efficiently calculates the minimum operations for any given n, demonstrating a deep understanding of algorithmic design and mathematical reasoning.
